# C# LLVM Custom Programming Language Series
This series will walk through steps needed to create a custom programming language using C# and the LLVMSharp Nuget Package.

## Structure
This series will be structured with two longer form videos covering the Lexer and the Parser. These will be stored as
seperate projects in the main folder
